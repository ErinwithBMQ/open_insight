# open_insight

This project mainly targets the division of technical fields of open source projects, and constructs a multi-agent division method, including Feature Word Paradigm Generation Agent, Feature Word Paradigm Clustering Agent, Feature Word Paradigm Classification Agent, etc. Through these agents, automated division and analysis of technical fields of open source projects can be achieved, thereby providing support for the management and maintenance of open source projects.

Currently, it mainly supports technical division in the AI field, using the Qwen3-8B model, and more model support will be added in the future.

# Usage Instructions

```bash
# Clone the project repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/open_insight.git

## Configure Result Directory, API Key, and URL

Add your desired save directory, API key, and URL in the `src/feature_extract/document_metric/config.ini` file:

```ini
[GLOBAL_PATHS]
tmp_path = 

[OPEN_CHECKService]
#gitee url
openai_api_key = YOUR_API_KEY_HERE

;osscompass all data url
open_search_url_metadata = 

;osscompass topics url
